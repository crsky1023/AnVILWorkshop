## Workshop Description

With the rapidly growing size of genomic-related data set, biomedical research faces
problems such as data storage, access, sharing, and computing. In this workshop, 
we introduce cloud-based genomics platform called [Terra](https://anvil.terra.bio/) 
as a potential solution. Terra hosts large-scale genomic and genomic-related data 
sets and provide secure access to them as well as individual data resources. Terra
also provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze these data and 
interactive analysis interfaces such as Jupyter notebook and RStudio. Users can also 
run best practice tools and pipelines already implemented or upload their own
data or analysis methods to workspaces. Workshop participants will learn how to
use Terra through the usecase example(s), instructor-led live demo, and AnVIL package. 


## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of R syntax
* (optional) [Terra account setup](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360034677651-Account-setup-and-exploring-Terra). Recommended if you want to follow instructor-led demo section on your own.

## Workshop Participation

Participants will have the opportunity to access pre-populated Terra workspace and run examples. 

## _R_ / _Bioconductor_ packages used

* [AnVIL](https://github.com/Bioconductor/AnVIL)

## Learning Goals

* Gain familiarity with cloud-based genomics platforms
* Learn how to assess data sets and tools provided through Terra
* Learn how to use interactive analysis apps
* Understand the benefit and shortcome of Terra
 
## Specific objectives

* Setup Terra account
* Clone a public/sharable workspace 
* Create a new workspace and import datasets/ workflows/ notebooks
* Use Jupyter notebook and RStudio in Terra
* Use AnVIL package to access Terra and R/Bioconductor resource
